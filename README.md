# React 2 CRUD
A small app to demo CRUD operations and React, using the 3rd-party API service mecallapi.com.

## Status 2021-08-12: 
Less than half-baked / not yet fully functional, there is some unused WIP code.
GET/index and PUT/CREATE are implemented.
A todo list is in the doc/ dir.

## Info:
This is a sister project to the one having the same funtionality and layout but implemented with 
jQuery and Bootstrap at https://github.com/brucedickey/cruds-r-us.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It has not yet been ejected.
