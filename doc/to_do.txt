To Do
===============================================================================

* Fix bugs.

* Refresh the people table via AJAX fetch() w/o reloading the page.

* Create the Display Profile modal.

* Create the Delete Person modal.

* Hook up the Display Profile, Update Person, and Delete Person functionality.

* Write tests.

* Run ESLint.

* Provide nice UI/UX error handling for HTTP methods.

* Eject from create-react-app.


BUGS:

* After running build and deploy, the path to the icon on the header was 
  changed, removing the PUBLIC macro. Now the icon cannot be found at run
  time; it is in the img/ dir.

* There is an infinite loop on the get index AJAX call.

* index.js:1 Warning: Cannot update a component (`PeopleTable`) while 
  rendering a different component (`PersonTableRow`). To locate the bad
  setState() call inside `PersonTableRow`, follow the stack trace as 
  described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render
