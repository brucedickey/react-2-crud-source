To Do
===============================================================================

* Fix bugs.

* Create the Display Profile modal.

* Create the Delete Person modal.

* Hook up the Display Profile, Update Person, and Delete Person functionality.

* Write tests.

* Run ESLint.

* Provide nice UI/UX error handling for HTTP methods.

* Eject from create-react-app?


BUGS:

* After running build and deploy, the path to the icon on the header was 
  changed, removing the PUBLIC macro. Now the icon cannot be found at run
  time; it is in the img/ dir.
